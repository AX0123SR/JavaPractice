Functional programming vs Object-oriented programming
        
    Functional programming where functions calls each other,
    talk to each other whereas in Object-Oriented programming 
    there are bunch of entities which talk to each other by passing messages
    and they have relationships amomng them.

Constructors

     Constructors are used to initialize the value of the object.
     As soon as object is created, its value got initialize.
     Constructors have no return type and having the same name as of class name.
     If no constructor is defined, default constructor is called.

Final

     Final are used to set the final values with the variables, methods or classes.
     Once assigned their values can't changed. You cannot instantiate a final class. 
     A final method cannot be derived in the child class. 

Interface

     Interface specifies what a class must do, it does not specifies how to do it.
     Interface have only body no definitions. It has public, static and final fields.
     A class implements as interface and interfaces extends multiple interfaces.
     Using Interfaces we can achieve Multiple Inheritance.

Abstraction

    Abstraction means hiding the implementation details and shwowing functionality to user.
    A class which is declared as abstract in known as abstract class.
    An abstract class must be extended but it can't be instantiated. 
    It can have abstract and non abstract method as well.
    An abstract class doesn't have no body.
    It is the responsibility of child class which extends the abstract class to provide implementation for the abstract method.
    It can have constructor, data member and methods as well.
